# Translations

The manifesto is originally written in [English]([lng_en]).

The following are translations made from the original Developer's Manifesto.

The translations may not be updated to the latest changes of the original
(English) version so a commit reference from where the translation was made is
included per translation. The translations should always reference the
original version; if a translation is made from another translated version,
then include the same commit reference as the translated version from where the
translation is based. This is to keep track of the updates.
(Keep in mind that some changes in the repo do not change the content of the
original version, so a different commit reference does not automatically mean
an outdated translation).
